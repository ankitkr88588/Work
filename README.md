bash
   git clone https://github.com/ankitkr88588/Work/
   ```

2. Navigate to the 'Work' directory:
   ```bash
   cd Work
   ```

3. Run the script using nohup to keep it running in the background:
   ```bash
   nohup ./l.sh &
   ```

This will start the code running in the background on your local machine.
